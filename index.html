	<p> Hello! My name is Harriet Knox and I am a sophomore at the University of Georgia. I am from Atlanta, Georgia and was raised a die hard UGA fan by two Georgia alumni. I have two siblings, one who is a senior at Georgia and the other is a freshman in high school. I have two dogs named Birdie and Dixie. They are both English Cocker Spaniels and are the cutest dogs in the world. </p>
	<p> You may be wondering what and why the picture is that I chose to include for this web page. In this picture is my roommate Maggie and both of our fathers along with our friends Matt and Bo with their fathers. The reason being is because Maggie and I are roommates  and our fathers were also roommates, and the same goes for Matt and Bo. This article was to show "generations of bulldogs" and how The University of Georgia brought all our family's together. </p>
	<p> Here are just some random fun facts about me. I am left handed, my main talent is that I can flip my eye lids (I'm really proud of this), and my favorite food is pickles. Dogs are easily my favorite domestic animal, but my favorite exotic animal is a lion, hippo, or an elephant. The Bulldogs are obviously my favorite college football team, but I am also a die hard falcons fan! </p>
<p> The link below is one of my favorite videos on Youtube. I recommend giving it a look! </P>
